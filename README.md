iotoolsExamples
===============

This project contains three examples of using the iotools package
for running jobs using hadoop streaming. It assumes that a working
Hadoop installation has already been set-up, and the iotools package
has been installed (tested using version 0.1-4).

The "create_data.R" script must be executed first to construct the
various datasets used in the examples.
